## Description 

As a manager of an absolute massive company and as a extreme backend developer, I would like to keep track of all my employees in a backend database application. Well well, does this repo have a solution for you!

## Usage

The application can be started in the commandline application of your choice. I used GitBash and it is very good. Once the application is started, it will give you a series of choice and might or might not ask questions depending on what your needs may be. Just press `Ctlr + C` to quit out of the update option as I could not make a function work inside there. Idk


## Installation

Run the command `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies for this application. Then change directories into the db folder and use mysql in order to set up tha database data. Run the schema first, the the seeds file. Then go out of that folder and run `node server.js`. The application will start up for you to use. In case of any complications, below is a video to help you out.
